**Jumper** is an application and script launching platform that allows you to **easily manage and distribute access** to various tools and processes to your users, all through a single, user-friendly interface.

  * **🚀 Simplified Distribution:** Centralize all your tools (software, web links, documents, internal scripts) in one place.
  * **🔒 Advanced Access Management:** Precisely control who can access and execute each tool using user accounts and groups.
  * **🐍 Native Script Execution:** Built-in native execution for **Python** and **Javascript** scripts, with no need to install external dependencies.
  * **🎨 Customizable Interface:** Personalize the interface (branding, sections, layout) for a tailored user experience.

Designed for simplicity, Jumper saves you time when distributing and maintaining your internal tools. To get started, check the [Getting Started guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=getting-started.md).

## 💡 Key Use Cases

### Centralized Company Application Gallery

Simplify the access and distribution of your key applications and internal tools. Jumper allows you to:

  * Distribute tools **only** to the people who need them, thanks to user and group-based access control.
  * Personalize application execution based on the user's role or environment.
  * Provide new employees with quick and clear access to all necessary tools in a unified interface (complete with descriptions and usage instructions).

If your company requires specific script executions (such as data processing, report generation, etc.), your users can run them directly from Jumper with a single click.

### Powerful Personal Script Launcher

Jumper is also a great tool for developers or administrators looking to **organize and launch their own scripts** and applications in a structured manner. Debugging tools are integrated to easily track script execution issues.

## 🛠️ Simplified Action Creation

Jumper allows you to create **Actions** (script or application executions) that can be run directly from the gallery interface.

1.  **Simple Form:** Each Action is created via a form where you define the **script code** (Python/Javascript), **execution parameters**, **environment variables**, and **access rules**.
2.  **Zero Dependencies:** Scripts are executed natively without the need to install any external dependencies.
3.  **User Options:** You can define **options** displayed to the user before execution (e.g., choosing a mode or parameter via a dropdown menu).
4.  **Rich User Interface:** Each Action is presented with a title, thumbnail, and description to help users understand its purpose and usage.

## 🛡️ Access Management and Enterprise Integration

In the Jumper administration interface (backoffice), you can create user accounts and group them into roles.

  * **Granular Control:** Each Action can be assigned to specific users or groups, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access it.
  * **SSO and Provisioning (SCIM):** Jumper supports **SSO** authentication and user/group provisioning via **OAuth 2.0** and **SCIM** protocols. Easily integrate Jumper with your existing identity provider (Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD, etc.).
  * **Action Workspaces:** Group Actions into distinct **workspaces**, allowing for the delegation of their administration among different teams or users.

## 🎨 Gallery Customization

Jumper allows you to customize the gallery interface to match your branding and needs:

  * **Branding:** Define a custom background image (or let users choose their own).
  * **Organization:** Group Actions into different **sections** to organize the gallery layout.
  * **User Flexibility:** Users can optionally reorder Actions in their gallery or hide the ones they do not use.
